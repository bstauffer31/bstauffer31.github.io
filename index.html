        Conference Rank: (10-11) 5th place, 7 games out of 1st place.  
        <br><br>
        The SVU Knights baseball team are coming off of a hot streak of 8 wins in 11 games, the logest winning streak of the season. The Knights missed the playoffs the last 4+ years, and have never made a playoff game since they have joined USA South Conference. However, this year they clinched a playoff spot last night with a win over William and Peace. The team has worked hard this season so secure this playoff spot, which landed then in 5th place due to having a better run differential than 6th place Pfeiffer. The last time the knights had a 20 win seaosn was in 2011, they were not yet in the USA South conference. The team hopes to achieve this win mark in the 2025 season. The Knights Baseball teams feature a younger starting 9 where just 2 seniors are present and the rest are 1 junior and 7 sophomores

          <br><br><br><br>
         The knights currently have 6 players hitting with over a .300 batting average. If a major league baseball player holds a lifetime .300 batting average he is easily voted into the hall of fame. The fact that we have 6 people hitting over .300 on this team is amazing.  
          <br>
          The combined team batting average is .301
          <br><br>
        Those 6 people are:
          <br>
          Zack Geertson- .402
          <br> 
          Stockton Hall- .358
          <br>
          Seth Lloyd- .303
          <br>
          Mitchell Smith- .345
          <br>
          Ty Martinez- .359
          <br>
          Marcelino Leonardo Jr.- .301

      <div id="show3" class="main noshow"> 
        Team fielding percentage: .943
        <br>
        The league fielding percentage is .950 which means that the knights are .07 below league average for fielding. The fielder with the most total assists (65) is Seth Lloyd. Seth also has the best infielder fieldig percentage on the team. 
        <br><br>
        The outfield in particular has made very little mistakes this season with having combined made fewer than 10 errors while having 2 put-outs above average. Right fielder Ty Martinez has made 4 diving catches saving 6 runs over the season which is the highest amount of runs saved by a Knight this year. Nick Daynes robbed a homerun ball at home against #25 nationally ranked NC Wesleyan in game 2 of the series. The knights went on to lose the 3rd game by 1 run, clearly displaying their potential against elite teams.

      <div id="show4" class="main noshow"> 
        Pitching 
        <br><br>
        The Knights have struggled to throw the ball effectively this year. The biggest weakness the Knights have is the lack of pitching. The Knights have not had a great pitching staff in a long time. A lot of the team would agree that this issue is due to the pitchers not having enough practice and not having a pitching coach to work with the players to develop their skills in the college level.
        <br>
        <br>
        3 Pitchers on this years team are transfers from Junior Colleges that were in a Wood Bat only conference. SVU is in a metal bat conference and the ball goes further with a metal bat than with a wood bat. It is understandable to have struggles with the different bat types that players use. 
        <br><br> 
        The best way for the knights to become successful at pitching is for the program to get a pitching coach and have the pitchers get on a throwing program. This would result in a more successful pitching staff.
